<h1 align="center">Semantic Kernel: Develop your AI Integrated Web App on Azure and .NET 8.0</h1>


## Introduction
Welcome to our cloud-powered adventure! In this blog post, we explore the intersection of technology and career guidance by diving into the world of Azure Container Apps and discovering how Semantic Kernel, Microsoft’s open-source development kit, can revolutionize your approach to career advice. Join us on this transformative journey as we integrate AI-driven solutions into web applications.

## Features
- **Semantic Kernel Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with .NET services to infuse AI capabilities into web applications.
- **Career Advice Enhancement**: The application suggests career paths, fetches job listings from third-party APIs, and crafts personalized skilling plans.
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Utilizes Terraform and Azure CLI scripts to build and deploy the entire infrastructure, including containerized applications.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implements Service Principal roles like AcrPull and AcrPush to secure the deployment process.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Frontend**: React-based user interface for seamless user interaction.
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core Web API integrated with Semantic Kernel for AI-driven recommendations.
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform for infrastructure as code and Azure CLI for container management.
- **Job Listings API**: Integrates external APIs to provide real-time job opportunities.
- **Security**: Managed Identity and role-based access control ensure secure communication with Azure resources.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the power of Semantic Kernel and .NET, demonstrating how AI can enhance web applications by providing personalized career advice. By leveraging Azure’s cloud infrastructure and automation tools, we’ve built a scalable and efficient solution that not only meets but exceeds user expectations.
